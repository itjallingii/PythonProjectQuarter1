# Research questions
Introductie op ondervoeding in landen gelegen in de sub-sahara.  
Verschillen van honger aan de hand van het gebruik van landbouwgrond, innovaties en voedselproductie.
Aan de hand van deze gegevens een schatting maken voor al deze veriabelen, maar vooral het effect op de ondervoeding/voedseltekort

Rob & Ivar decided to look into target 2 - Zero Hunger


*Assignment*
Create a Jupyter Notebook that contains your explanations and analyses. Start the notebook with a
clear description of your research question and the type of analysis you are going to perform. The
conceptual contents of the Notebook should be roughly similar to a normal written report of 10-20
pages. Make your Notebook self-explanatory. So, it should contain text (with references) as well as
your actual analysis code and results. If you want to use other libraries for your analyses or
visualizations, feel free to do so. However, only use free available and well-known libraries. The ones
that come standard with Anaconda are fine. If you want to use something else, that you first need to
install, check with us first. Create a zip archive and upload it on Brightspace.
Some (minimum) properties of the Notebook and your analyses on which we will grade:
- Demonstrate your skills in Python by using typical Python constructs and using the appropriate
data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays, dataframes, series, recursion, etc.)
- Try to think of reusability of your code. How easy would it be to use your same code if we
want to try to do a small variations of your analysis? Can we easily adapt/play around with
your code?
- How difficult were your analyses?
