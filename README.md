# Research questions [OUTDATED - SEE PYTHON REPORT]
optie 1: To what extend is the way food is produced related to hunger in sub-saharan africa and how will this trend develop until 2030? 

subquestions:

- What indicators strongly relate to zero hunger?
- How did those indicators developed in the last decades (for individual countries in subharan africa)?

- What the differences in hunger between countries? 
- What is causing these differences, is this related to the way food is produced?

- How will the indicators regarding zero hunger goals develop until 2030 under the influence of certain policies?

optie 2: What indicators strongly relate to the production of food in sub-sahara africa and and how will the overall trend in hunger in SS africa look like?

*Assignment*
Create a Jupyter Notebook that contains your explanations and analyses. Start the notebook with a
clear description of your research question and the type of analysis you are going to perform. The
conceptual contents of the Notebook should be roughly similar to a normal written report of 10-20
pages. Make your Notebook self-explanatory. So, it should contain text (with references) as well as
your actual analysis code and results. If you want to use other libraries for your analyses or
visualizations, feel free to do so. However, only use free available and well-known libraries. The ones
that come standard with Anaconda are fine. If you want to use something else, that you first need to
install, check with us first. Create a zip archive and upload it on Brightspace.
Some (minimum) properties of the Notebook and your analyses on which we will grade:
- Demonstrate your skills in Python by using typical Python constructs and using the appropriate
data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays, dataframes, series, recursion, etc.)
- Try to think of reusability of your code. How easy would it be to use your same code if we
want to try to do a small variations of your analysis? Can we easily adapt/play around with
your code?
- How difficult were your analyses?
